    <h1>
        General cases
    </h1>
   
    <p>
        1.  barrel roll
        <br>Goal: to allow the drone to perform a barrel roll
        <br>Why: to increase the drone's range of actions 
        <br>
        <br>Step 1: While Hovering, the left 2 propelers spin extremely fast while the right 2 propelers slow down greatly or stop entirely, causeing the drone to flip over
        <br>Step 2: After rolling a full 360 degrees, all four propelers quickly spin at equal speeds to keep the drone off the ground
        <br>
        <br>
        2.  flip in mid-air
        <br>Goal: to allow the drone to perform mid-air flips
        <br>Why: to increase the drone's range of actions.
        <br>
        <br>Step 1: While hovering, the front 2 propelers spin extremely fast while the back 2 propelers slow down greatly or stop entirely, fliping the drone over
        <br>step 2: after making a full 360 flip, all four propelers quickly spin at equal speeds to keep the drone off the ground.
        <br>
        <br>
        3.  fly in any direction
           <br>Goal: to allow the drone to fly in any direction
           <br>Why: A drone has much more use if it is able to move
           <br>
           <br>Step 1: spin all 4 propelers in a way which lifts the drone up
           <br>Step 2: slow down the propeler speed enough to where the drone hovers in place without moving up or down
           <br>Step 3: have the drone tilt itself in the direction you want it to go. For example, if you want the drone to move left, have it tilt itself to the left.

    Special cases
</h1>

<p>
    Attach to a nerf gun
    <br>Goal: Shoot people with nerf darts
    <br>Why: shooting people with nerf darts is fun
    <br>
    <br>Step 1: take apart a motorized nerf gun and use 3D printing to reconfigure it into a form small and light enought to fit on the drone.
    <br>Step 2: connect the nerf gun wirelessly to a controller, perferably one that also controls the drone's flight
    <br>Step 3: attach the gun to the drone
    <br>Step 4: once the gun is attached, pressing a button on the controller will send a signal to the drone to fire the nerf gun.
